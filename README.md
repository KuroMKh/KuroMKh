Hi there! 👋
I'm just a regular dude who loves tech, coding, and a good challenge. 🚀

👨‍💻 About Me
🎓 Computer Science (Software Development) Student @ UniSZA, Terengganu
🎓 Diploma Graduate | Politeknik Muadzam Shah, Pahang (Same field, still coding!)
💡 Passionate about learning, experimenting, and absorbing new knowledge

💻 What I'm Up To
🔥 Building Web & PWA Applications with PHP + Vue.js
☁️ Exploring Cloud Computing & Machine Learning (Because why not?)
🛠️ Tinkering with new tech and breaking things just to fix them again (it’s called debugging, right? 😆)

🚀 Let's Connect & Build!
I’m always up for collaborations, tech talks, or just sharing cool ideas. Hit me up
